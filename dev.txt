the text file format doesn’t have any special file format specifications. Text files have “text/plain” MIME type and have little or no formatting at all. This enables text editors to open such files without any other requirements. The default character set of text files is ASCII that is used for creating and display of text file contents. Characters are encoded using ASCII character set, but this imposes limitation of usage on characters such as Pound Sign, Dollar and Euro sign that can’t be represented using the ASCII character set. Thus, text files can also be saved in Unicode format, with UTF-8 being the mostly used.
